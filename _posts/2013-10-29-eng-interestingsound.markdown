title: Basic Sound Effects used in Film Scenes
---

I discovered an intersting [website](http://obiwannabe.co.uk/) generating various sound effects which can be used in movie scenes, games and other situations. The website holder as well as sound designer is the author of book "Designing Sound". That book is quite absorbing and it mainly talks about sound design in movies and games. Similarly, it's also the theme of this website. I'm going to demonstrate some audio outputs using codes offered on this site.

Click "boom" in the patch, you will hear a sound same as the linked voice.

The timbre is random along time, because the randomness of fundamental frequency and harmonics.

This patch generates up-arpeggiator sound by synchronously combining 3 voices.
