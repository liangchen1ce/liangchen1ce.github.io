I attended Slork(Stanford Laptop Orchestra) summer seminar in 2014 and I made a program for the final concert programming with ChucK.

#### Tinnitus

When a soldier wakes up in the battlefield, what would be in his mind? Tinnitus is the name of my program describing the annoying sound in this soldier's ear. The program maps controller's real-time motion into audio synthesis parameters or audio samples playback parameters and then put generated audio into different channels.
