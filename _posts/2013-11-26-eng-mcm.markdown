#### Background
In this problem, we are asked to improve the efficiency of baking process,
namely, the maximum sum area of cakes (in a certain thickness) once can be
placed in an oven and the extent to which the cakes are evenly baked, through
the adjustment of the shape of pans. Therefore, it involves both thermodynamics
theory and two-dimensional packing problem.
#### Structure
Our paper is organised as follows. First, an ideal thermal model is developed
to simulate the heat distribution of pans in different shapes. Next, under the
requirement of maximizing the number of pans, a group of overlapped circles
is used to approximately calculate the number of pans that can be placed into
an oven. Finally, according to the heat distribution computed by the first model,
the pan with most even distribution is selected.
