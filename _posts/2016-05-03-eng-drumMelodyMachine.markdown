This is the course project for Computer Music Systems and Information Processing S16 in CMU.

#### The Drum & Melody Machine
The Drum Machine Part: Users draw different shapes such as triangle, circle, zig-zag, etc, on the Graphic User Interface. Different shapes correspond to different instruments. The shape position on x-axis corresponds to the drum pattern. 

The Melody Machine Part: Users draw lines, and our program fills the staff with the drawn lines. The rhythm pattern and mode pattern is preset and can be changed in real-time.

The Synchronization Part: These two machines run on 2 computers, and we used OSC (Open Sound Control) to communicate between the drum machine and the melody machine, making their produced music to be synchronized.
