title: ofxAudioUnit + ofxParticleEmitter -> AmplitudeTrigger and ParameterChanger
---
#### Background
OpenFramework is a rather interesting open source toolkit for creative coding, basing on C++. I chose two ofxAddons: [ofxAudioUnit](https://github.com/admsyn/ofxAudioUnit) and [ofxParticleEmitter](https://github.com/sroske/ofxParticleEmitter) to create openFramework projects because itâ€™s always a great idea for me to make audio interaction applications.


I made an attempt to use these two addons, created ParameterChanger combining the examples from these two addons. As the mouse moves, the parameters of music will change, more specifically, the x axis will affect the playback rate, and the y axis will affect the cutoff frequency. Furthermore, position of particle will also be affected by mouse position.

After the initial attempt, I try to use environment sound to interact with particle emitter.
