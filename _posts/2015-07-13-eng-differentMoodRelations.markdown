This is a visualization on relations between emotion labels of a song. Numbers on other labels reveal the frequency of co-occurance, when two labels occur in the same song. And the number appearing next to its own emotion label, reveals the frequency of independently occur in one song.

It's a simple implementation in [d3.js](http://d3js.org).
