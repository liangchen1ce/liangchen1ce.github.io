# FindNewAlbums

A simple implementation in [d3.js](http://d3js.org).

Based on [Clustered Force Layout III](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7881887).

Data scrarched from [RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com). Using top 18 albums listed in RYM, find lists including these albums respectively, and get albums inside these lists, then map relating albums with the original albums to show the albums similar with the original ones.

Open index.html file for data visualization.
