This is a simple visualization on how valence and arousal data in V-A space can relate to human labelled emotion tags. Valence and arousal data are fetched from the Echo Nest api. Click on the spots, 30-sec preview will be played(hosted on Spotify).

It's a simple implementation in [d3.js](http://d3js.org).
