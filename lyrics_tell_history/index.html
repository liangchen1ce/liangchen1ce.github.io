<p>What can we find in lyrics? Can we see history? With this doubt, we carried out a study on the trend of words used in lyrics, and try to get some relations between our resulting words, and the history.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-our-data"><a class="header-link" href="#introduction-to-our-data"></a>Introduction to our data</h2>
<p>To start the research, we need to get the proper data. In this study, we collected the full billboard <a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">THE HOT 100</a> charts as basis, and got all lyrics available using <a href="https://developer.musixmatch.com">Musixmatch API</a>.</p>
<p>The HOT 100 chart spans a range from Aug 09, 1958 to July 25, 2015, and released every week. </p>
<p>Here are some statistics:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>2973 charts in total</li>
<li>26988 unique songs</li>
<li>22196 unique lyrics, eliminating instrumental songs, and songs without available lyrics</li>
<li>Spanned a period of 58 years</li>
</ul>
<p>In this study, we analyze trending words in 3 levels -- week, year and decade. So we could get the most important words for every week, every year and every decade.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested about <em>how data is processed</em>, please see section <strong><a href="#technique-details">Technique Details</a></strong> below.</p>

<p>These are the top words in different time periods. Click on the circle, and get the topwords on the right.

<p>To have a better idea, you can fill in specific words, and get the total number they appear in each year.

<p>Some top-words in the 21th century are not that popluar in the good old days.
<!-- To get a general sense of this trend, we again calculated the total occurances of <a href="https://github.com/shutterstock/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/blob/master/en">these words</a>, in each year.
// Draw line chart of one general line of vulgar words. --></p>

<h3 id="how-the-data-is-collected-"><a class="header-link" href="#how-the-data-is-collected-"></a>How the data is collected?</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, we first got a list of songs that have been on billboard THE HOT 100 chart, and collected the lyrics using Musixmatch. </p>
<p>The following chart is the statistics of returned value using Musixmatch API.</p>
<iframe class="frames" id="MusixmatchResult" frameborder="0" height="530" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="vis/MusixmatchResult/index.html" width=100%></iframe>
<p>We can only analyze songs with English lyrics, which is shown in the top chart.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we couldn&#39;t get all lyrics of all the songs, because of authorization problem, foreign language problem, and not-covered-by-database problem(We realized that cover songs like sung by Glee or Pitch Perfect are not likely to be found). But most of the not-covered-by-database problem occured in before 2000. So at least we could get better result in years after 2000s.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-data-is-weighted-"><a class="header-link" href="#how-the-data-is-weighted-"></a>How the data is weighted?</h3>
<p>It becomes natural to think about weighting on the rank of songs - help higher ranked songs have more weights so their lyrics become more important. That&#39;s what we do - we collect all songs in one time period, and weight the words in their lyrics by the highest rank they ever reached.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-importance-is-determined-"><a class="header-link" href="#how-the-importance-is-determined-"></a>How the importance is determined?</h3>
<p>We used the numerical statistic called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a>. It shows how important a word is in its document, compared to the full collection.</p>
<p>In our example, to get the top words in a week(like in week starting with 1958-Aug-09), we take the lyrics in songs of that week as one document, and consider all lyrics in this year&#39;s chart as the collection. </p>
<p>To get the top words in a year, lyrics in this year are the document, and lyrics in the current decade are the collection. </p>
<p>Further, to get top words in the decade, lyrics in the current decade are seen as one document, and all 58 years&#39; lyrics are the corpus.</p>
<h1 id="comments-on-further-improvement"><a class="header-link" href="#comments-on-further-improvement"></a>Comments on further improvement</h1>
<p>To our surprise, some words that are closely related to history, like &#39;war&#39; and &#39;peace&#39;, are not shown in the final top words. That&#39;s because these words are so commonly used in lyrics, so our algorithm doesn&#39;t see them as unique and important. </p>
<p>One possible way is to reduce the appearance of a certain word in one document to 0 when this number is less than tenth of the maximum occurance in all documents. Thus the idf of this word will decrease and the tf-idf will increase. Your opinions are welcomed to help with better selection of top words.</p>
